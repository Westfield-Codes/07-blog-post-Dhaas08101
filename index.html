<h1>Open Source: Platform For The People</h1>
  <p><em>Oct 7, 2025 by Dylan Haas<a href="mailto:dylan209182@student-schoolsofwestfield.org"></a></em></p>
   <hr>
   <p>When you go to make anything, one of the first steps is building a foundation for your project, and in terms of the internet, you're most likely looking for software to work with. This can become quite the problem when you realize <strong>there are two main types of software you can use: open source and commercial source software.</strong> This dilemma tends to confuse most, so let me walk you through the differences between the two.</p><br>
   <h3>What Is Open Source Software?</h3><br>
   <p><strong>Open source software is software developed by an individual or group of people without the intent of restricting the source code or monetizing from its use.</strong> These softwares are often made to be broad and flexible, allowing it to do a plethora of things. This is further catapulted when you introduce a coder to the situation as they can <strong>alter the code in any way they want,</strong> making the software generally better or adding specific functions, which they can then release back to the public for everyone to use that version/update.</p>

   <h3 style="font-size:40px">Pros</h3>
      <ul><li>Cheap/free</li>
        <li>The source code is available to everyone, allowing users to modify it to their liking</li>
        <li>Both communal groups and the creators can work on the software</li>
      </ul> <br>
    <h3 style="font-size:40px">Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Support can be slow for open source software</li>
        <li>Open source software isn’t as compatible with other softwares/websites</li>
        <li>Security issues arise without professional protection</li>
        <li>Is often more complex than commercial software</li>
      </ul> <br>
  <h3>What Is Commercial Source Software?</h3><br>
   <p><strong>Commercial source software is software developed by a private group, company, or organization that is built for more specific purposes that requires a license to use.</strong> The main goal of these softwares is to generate money through the licensing, leading to a more refined and polished product. These softwares are closed off to everyone but the creators, so others can’t lay claim to it or edit it in any way, only professional developers are allowed to modify the source code, leading to more regular and progressive updates.</p>

   <h3 style="font-size:40px">Pros</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Has professional support services (like tech support or customer service)</li>
        <li>Compatible with other softwares and websites</li>
        <li>Has high levels of security to protect your data/their code</li>
        <li>Often designed to be easy to use/access</li>
        <li>Often has extensive documentation and user guides</li>
      </ul><br>
    <h3 style="font-size:40px">Cons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Can cost a pretty penny (either one and done purchase or subscription)</li>
        <li>Very little customization (source code is protected and cannot be altered by a customer)</li>
        <li>Not always flexible to access (can be limited in how you access it)</li>
        <li>The software is handled by a company, so it may not always adhere to the customers but rather work against them</li>
        </ul> <br>
      <h3>Why Should You Choose Open Source?</h3> <br>
      <p>It is the cheaper option, you get to use this software for free or for a small price and it is highly customisable if you know what you are doing. Open source also gives you whole communities to work with to update or discover new softwares to use, giving you a world wide web (pun intended) of communications and knowledge to work with.</p> <br>

      <h3>Why Others Choose Commercial Source</h3><br>
      <p>While it is the more expensive option, it comes with its perks. You get professional grade software to work with as you please, having any help along the way if you need it. You get software that was specifically designed for a certain purpose, making it more fine tuned to your goals.</p> <br>
